# Minecraft-SKripts
Ready to use Skripts for Minecraft Servers who use Spigot plugin "Skript" in 1.21.

Those scripts were used for my own server. You can use them or modify them at your ease.
They might have some bugs or errors.

Some features where specific for my server, but I let them in to showcases Skript features.
